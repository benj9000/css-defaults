# CSS defaults

A collection of CSS rules that I like to build on.

## Sources

- Base rule set: Josh W. Comeau's [A Modern CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/).
    - Removed rules about [root stacking context](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/#nine-root-stacking-context-10).
